# Team 7407 Grabby Robot Code

## Subsystems

### Drivetrain
The swerve drivetrain on the prototype uses Rev Spark MAX motor controllers, an 
ADI gyroscope, and _(eventually)_ CTRE CANCoders for zeroing the turn motors.

### Grabber
This subsystem controls the solenoids responsible for raising and engaging the
grabber.

### Intake
This subsystem controls the intake motors on the grabber.
